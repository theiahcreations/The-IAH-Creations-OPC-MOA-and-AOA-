# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

As these are legal and corporate documents, the security of sensitive information (like subscriber addresses and PAN/DIN details) is paramount.

### Handling Sensitive Information

- **Do Not Exposure Publicly:** Never commit actual PAN, DIN, or bank details to a public repository. Use placeholders for draft versions.
- **Reporting:** If you discover any sensitive information exposed in the commit history, please report it immediately to **theiahcreations@gmail.com**.

### Vulnerability Reporting

We appreciate proactive security reports. Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities; instead, email us directly.
